A ReplicaSet is a process that runs multiple instances of a Pod and 
keeps the specified number of Pods constant. Its purpose is to maintain the specified number of Pod instances 
running in a cluster at any given time to prevent users from losing access to their application when a Pod fails or is inaccessible.
